# animation-utilities

Animation utilities for Jibo's coordinated expression output.

This module is composed of a number of useful libraries:
- **animation-animate:** Implementation classes for the animate API: animation builders, look-ats, transitions, etc.
- **animation-body:** Classes for connecting animation-utilities to Jibo's body services/simulator.
- **animation-macros:** Helper macros for common animation API setup tasks.
- **animation-visualize:** Implementation of the visualize API: WebGL canvases for Jibo's eye and body.
- **geometry-info:** Utility classes for working with robot configuration and geometry info.
- **geometry-config:** Content files specifying robot geometry, kinematics, and related config.
- **ifr-core:** IFR core utility classes.
- **ifr-geometry:** IFR base classes for 3D geometry/graphics.
- **ifr-motion:** IFR tools for working with robot degrees-of-freedom, procedural motions, and animations.
- **ifr-visualizer:** IFR utility classes for working with 3D scenes.
